# Project Title

Audio-Processing: Transcribe-Condense

# Description 

Our project introduces a smart system for understanding videos better using sound.

It starts by taking a video and pulling out just the sound from it.

Then, it listens to the words spoken in the video and turns them into text.

This helps to study the video content in detail.

We then simplify the text using computers to give a quick overview.

Also, our system can read out the text aloud using a computer-generated voice.

This makes it easier for people to understand the video, especially those who might struggle with reading.

In summary, our project makes it easier to study videos by pulling out the spoken words, summarizing them, and offering an option to listen to the text.
